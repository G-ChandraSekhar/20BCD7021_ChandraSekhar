                <p>This is my Portfolio website where it is our first quarter project. I truly encourage such initatives because it promotes team work, and a real test for our knowledge.
                    <br>
                    It is also an opportunity to learn, grow, and get our hands dirty on various range of topics in Web development.

                 <img class="clip-path" src="Chandra Sekhar.jpg" alt="This is Chandra Sekhar Image" title="Chandra Sekhar's Image">
                 <p>I am presently (as on Nov,2021) pursuing Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Engineering with specializations in Data Analytics from Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT). I am an enthusiastic and avid learner of technologies and its evolution showcasing an exemplary quest for learning and have keen bending to minute things. I would like to take up roles which demands higher application of physical and mental aptitudes.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     I am a kind of person who likes to give it back to the society because I believe if we do not share the knowledge with others then itâ€™s a mere exercise in floccinaucinihilipilification because if we are good with the intent, the whole universe will conspire helping us achieve that.
                     I am firm believer of <q>A man is literally what he thinks, his character being the complete sum of all his thought</q>as stated by James Allen in his book <q>As a man thinketh</q>. So, I would like to keep things simple, clutter less so that I can make myself comfortable in any sort of situation. And also, in my philosophy, if a personâ€™s character is lost, everything is lost. So, I constantly work upon my character also would like to see others working on the same and agreeing on it without any inhibitions.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     Let me further take you deep into my thoughts. I enjoy simple pleasures of life because <q>The simple things are also the most extraordinary things, and only the wise can see them</q> as it is wonderfully quoted by Paulo Coelho in <q>The Alchemist</q>. I draw inspiration from many people from different walks of life because I believe itâ€™s the fire within, passion within that drives us and I cannot afford to lose that. 
                     <br>
                      On a lighter note, you must have understood by this time that I am an Panglossian and I make no bones about it ðŸ˜Š. I had tried to be as eloquent as I can in expressing my thoughts, hope you were able to get the feel of my thoughts.
